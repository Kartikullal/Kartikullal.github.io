              <h3>Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Score Prediction</h3>
              <p>
                Diagnosing depression, stress or anxiety can be extremely difficult, as it can affect different people in different ways. In addition, there is currently little understanding of the universal predictors of them. There are not enough clear risk factors for mental health professionals to look for when diagnosing a patient. This makes it difficult to tell mental illness apart from normal levels of stress, sadness, and anxiety. Our goal is to use the data from the DASS responses, combined with demographic information, to find possible predictors of depression, anxiety and stress. We hope to add to the growing research surrounding mental illness by identifying possible risk factors. In our study, we have used Python to implement data import, cleaning, visualizations and prediction.

              <h3>Comparative Study of Efficacy of Machine Learning Algorithms in Stock Market</h3>
              <p>
                Artificial intelligence is to trading what fire was to cavemen.The future of stock trading is being shaped by machine
learning. Major financial institutions are attempting to beat the stock market by employing machine learning algorithms to
identify patterns or indicators that may be used to forecast trends. Because the stock market is largely influenced by human
emotion, no computer can guarantee a trend, hence the race to find the best algorithm continues. The goal of this project is to
perform comparative analysis and to find the best one out of five most commonly used algorithms - Support Vector Regression
(SVR), Random Forest (RF), K- Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA). I evaluated these algorithms based on three performance metrics and test them on datasets of
stock prices of Reliance, Cipla and HDFC - three Indian companies of different domains - and presented the algorithm that provides
the most satisfactory forecast.

                According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

              <h3>Nedler-Mead Algorithm - Python Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                The Nelder-Mead algorithm or simplex search algorithm, originally published in 1965 (Nelder and Mead, 1965), is one of the best known algorithms for multidimensional unconstrained optimization without derivatives. This method should not be confused with Dantzig's simplex method for linear programming, which is completely different, as it solves a linearly constrained linear problem.

              <h3>Interval Bisection Search Algorithm - Python Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this implementation, I have considered the convex function f(x) = x^2. You can change the convex functiont to whatever you like.

In this implementation, I have also counted the number of steps that will be needed to reach the minimum point.

              <h3>Golden Section Search - Python Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                The golden-section search is a technique for finding an extremum (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval. For a strictly unimodal function with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them.

            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>I am pursuing my Master's in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston. I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology from Mumbai University.</p>

            <p>During my former years of undergraduate studies, I always aspired to be a software developer. However, during my junior and senior years, I was introduced to data science topics such as data mining, artificial intelligence, Business intelligence, and it completely blew my mind. During my undergraduate thesis, I worked on a comparative study of machine learning algorithms in the stock market, and that's when I realized how fascinating it is to work with data.</p>
              
            <p>I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. I want to pursue data science because I want the business to use data to maximize its value. I have several projects showcasing my work and expertise in exploratory data analysis and machine learning.
