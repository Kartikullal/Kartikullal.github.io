                            In this project, I developed an ML model that predicts depression, stress, and anxiety scores based on personality traits and demographics. We used a StackCVRegressor algorithm with several regression techniques, including Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Through visualization, we identified key parameters that had a high correlation with the scores. The model achieved an RMSE of 10, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting mental health scores.

                        <p>
                            This project focuses on developing a book recommendation system using various algorithms. The data sources include book recommendation and Amazon book reviews datasets. I cleaned and processed the data by merging, dropping null values, and creating a Book-Rating database. The algorithms used in this project are Popularity-based filtering, Item-based collaborative filtering, User-based collaborative filtering, Content-based filtering, and Neural collaborative filtering. These algorithms help in suggesting novels based on popular books, past user behavior, user-item similarity matrix, and feature vectors. The project aims to provide accurate book recommendations to users and can also be useful for libraries to suggest books to their readers.

                            I trained a deep learning algorithm to flag potential covid-19 infected in chest x-rays. The deep learning algorithm used is a Convolutional Neural Network that is 121 layers deep. Due to the lack of a large open-source of covid-19 infected x-ray images, I combined data from five different sources. Combined, the dataset has 17,194 images that are used for training procedure. The model classifies a given chest X- ray image as either a "Normal", "Covid-19", or a "Pneumonia" infection. The trained model has a 0.93 F1 Score and 93.496% accuracy.

                        <p>
                            I analyzed five different models, LSTM, k-NN, Random Forest, SVR, and ARIMA, to determine their effectiveness in predicting stock markets across three datasets. To evaluate the models, we utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, and compared their root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Upon examination of the models, we concluded that ARIMA performed the best relative to the other models, showing a 10% improvement in both RMSE and MAPE.

                        <p>
                            This project aimed to analyze the likelihood of stroke based on various factors such as age, gender, medical conditions (glucose, hypertension, etc.), marital status, and employment. The project utilized R libraries such as Dplyr, Tidyr, and ggplot2 to visualize the probability of a stroke with the ten factors. After analyzing the data, the project identified a correlation between age, medical conditions, and employment status with a heart stroke. To predict the possibility of a stroke accurately, the project employed a logistic regression model that achieved 86% accuracy. This project aimed to improve our understanding of the factors that contribute to the risk of stroke and help healthcare providers make informed decisions to prevent strokes.
